# apache_parser.py

This is a Python script and command-line tool,
with no dependencies, that allows parsing data
from Apache log files.

At this time it supports generating supports for:

* **uri** - pageviews for each uri
* **time** - datetime with highest request/second
* **status_code** - hits for each http status code
* **referral** - uris of referring sites
* **agent** - hits for each user agent
* **subscriptions** - the number of feed subscribers per uri.
    This is done by parsing user agents for their subscriber count.

## Usage

Here are some example uses:

    python parser.py access.log subscriptions
    python parser.py access.log uri --quantity 5
    python parser.py access.log agent --cutoff 100

There is help available at the command-line as well.

    python parser.py --help
